# Project Starter

In this activity we will add the provided boilerplate to group project repos.

## Instructions

* Only one member of each group should complete this activity while the others watch.

* Copy the entire [Unsolved](Unsolved) folder to another location on your computers &mdash; wherever you would like your local copy of the group project to be.

* Rename the copied "Unsolved" folder to the name of your project.

* Open the copied project folder's `package.json` file and change its `name` property to the name of your project.

* CD to the root of the copied project folder with your terminal and run the following commands:

  ```
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  ```

* Then copy the GitHub repo's remote SSH URL (the same URL you'd use to clone the repo).

* Run the following commands in your terminal, replacing <remote-url> with your GitHub repo's remote SSH URL.

  ```
  git remote add origin <remote-url>
  git push origin master
  ```

* If completed successfully you should see all of the files uploaded to GitHub.

* All other group members should now clone the repo.

* Discuss as a group:

  * How would you now add changes to this project?


Laxman, Rebecca and Chandra decided to form a group and work together to build a website app as project #2. The group brainstormed to come up with an idea to develop an app from ground up. After couple ideas,  the group agreed on developing an Astrology app. The app would take in three parameters (first name, last name and the day the user ws born) and the app would fetch data from MySQL database on characteristics/personality, hobbies, partners, lucky nos. phobia etc, a set of eight fields. The app also would  Similarly display another user with separate day of birth would get eight fields with same topics but different content. 

"Astrology App" is a project work prepared by Rebecca, Laxman and Chandra "Astro-NUTS". This project work is conceptualized and built from scratch. The information in the website is derived from multiple researches done online. It is compiled after careful comparision and evaluation from multiple websites.  We have picked the most common characteristics, paraphrased them concisely before loading into the database. The results may or may not match with one or many. The developers do not have illicit or malicious intention to hurt any individual living or dead by creating this app. Resemblence to anybody  will only be an unpleasant coincidence. Remember the developers are Astro-NUTS.
